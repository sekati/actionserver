It functions as the _networking glue_ for any _real-time multi-user_ or _hybrid technology_ application.\r\n\r\nThe daemonized server opens `TCP port 2229` for incoming connections, awaits a `channel` join command (_this allows for a single server instance to host many different applications without message overflow_), then broadcasts any messages received from clients to all other connected clients in real-time.\r\n\r\n**The Sekati ActionServer has been successfully deployed in many different use-cases such as:**\r\n\r\n* Multi-user Flash Websites:\r\n\t* To allow users to view each others cursors & clicks in realtime by acting as an ``XMLSocket`` server: [classic.sekati.com](http://classic.sekati.com).\r\n* Physical Computing Projects:\r\n\t* To communicate between X-Bee Wireless Arduino's & a receiving Web Application: [SM Office Metrics](http://www.sekati.com/work/sm-metrics).\r\n\t* To communicate between an SMS Text Message Gateway & an interactive projections: [Pathways SMS Installation](http://www.sekati.com/work/pathways-installation).\r\n\r\n\r\nServer Details\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn addition to the primary `actionserver` daemon & `actionserverctl` control script - a second daemon `socketpolicyserver` is shipped/installed to support flash & air applications which require a special [crossdomain XML policy](http://www.lightsphere.com/dev/articles/flash_socket_policy.html) be served on a specific socket.\r\n\r\n_The following is key usage information to know about the `actionserver` & `socketpolicyserver` daemons:_\r\n\r\n**ActionServer Daemon** (defaults may be changed in ``actionserver.c``)\r\n\r\n* TCP Port: ``2229``\r\n* Max Clients: ``500``\r\n* Max Message Buffer: ``4Kb``\r\n* Log Channel: ``*gimmeallchannel*`` - this is a special control channel which a client may join in order to monitor traffic across all \"channels\".\r\n* Log File: ``/tmp/actionserver.log`` - automatically rotated.\r\n* Messages: ``\\0`` - a ``NULL`` character is used to terminate each transmitted & received message (_this is default behavior in AS3 & Wiring / Processing_).\r\n* Joining: When connecting to the actionserver the 1st message string defines your ``\"room\"`` or ``channel``: you will only receive messages transmitted by other clients who have joined the same ``\"room\"``. This allows you to use the server for multiple applications. __Please note this means immediately upon connecting your client must send a string defining it's room followed by the ``\\0`` NULL character.\r\n\r\n\r\n**SocketPolicyServer Daemon**\r\n\r\n* TCP Port: ``1843`` - while the default adobe socket server is ``843`` running daemons on ports below ``1024`` requires running as the ``root`` user so we run on a high port (be sure to point any flash/air clients at the modified port: this is illustrated in the ``example`` application).\r\n* Log File: ``/tmp/socketpolicy.log``\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. Unarchive & in your terminal change to the actionserver directory: ``cd /path/to/actionserver/``\r\n2. Compile the ActionServer for your environment: ``make``\r\n3. Install the ActionServer binaries: ``make install`` (you will be prompted for your ``root`` password for installation).\r\n4. Run the control script (see _Packaging List_ section below for more details): ``actionserverctl start``\r\n\t* This will daemonize the ``actionserver`` & ``socketpolicyserver`` making them ready for use.\r\n5. To check the status of the servers type: ``actionserverctl status``\r\n6. To follow the log files for the servers type: ``actionscriptctl log``\r\n7. To stop the servers type: ``actionscriptctl stop``\r\n\r\n_If you run in to trouble while compiling or installing the binaries you may run ``make uninstall`` to start over or type ``make help`` for more information._\r\n\r\n  \r\nBuild Requirements\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n* GNU Make\r\n* GNU GCC Compiler\r\n* Perl (_for companion socket policy server_)\r\n\r\n\r\nRuntime Requirements\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n__*The ActionServer is an extremely light-weight & low requirement \r\napplication meant to run on nearly any operating system:*__\r\n\t\r\n* Any unix-like Operating System (_happily compiles on most Linux, Unix, BSD, Mac OS X, et. al_)\r\n* ActionServer should compile/run on Windows systems with only minor modifications; _CYGWin is recommended as a good place to start_.\r\n\r\n  \r\nPackaging List\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\t  \r\n* __*Makefile*__ - The ActionServer Makefile: see the _Installation_ section above for more.\r\n\r\n* __*src/*__ - ActionServer C source code.\r\n\r\n* __*examples/*__ - Flash example app which illustrates connecting, sending, receiving & disconnecting.\r\n\r\n* __*bin/*__ - runtime binaries.\r\n\r\n\t* __*actionserverctl*__ - Control interface designed to help the administrator control the functioning of the daemon.\r\n\t\t* _usage_: `./actionserverctl [ command ]`\r\n\t\t* `start` - Start the ActionServer & Socket Policy Server daemons.\r\n\t\t* `stop` - Stop the ActionServer & Socket Policy Server daemons.\r\n\t\t* `status` - Displays a brief status report on the daemons statuses.\r\n\t\t* `log` - Tail the log files for both daemons.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t* __*actionserver*__ - The ActionServer Daemon: _do not run this application directly; instead use `actionserverctl`_.\r\n\t\r\n\t* __*socketpolicyserver*__ - Adobe Socket Policy Server Daemon to support Flash & Air applications.  \r\n\r\n  \r\nChangelog\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\t8/28/11 - *v1.1.0\r\n\t\t- Added a proper Makefile\r\n\t\t- Repackaged for Github release.\r\n\t\t- Revises `actionscriptctl` control script\r\n\t\t- Revised build.sh compilation script\r\n\t\t- Revised channel password\r\n\t\t- Added detailed README instructions (this document)\r\n\t\t- added includes to string.h & stdlib.h to surpress gcc warnings\r\n\r\n\t2/8/10 - *v1.0.9*\r\n\t\t- Added proper LICENSE.txt\r\n\t\t- added socketpolicyserver.pl & integrated actionserverctl script\r\n\t\t- pointed logging facility to /tmp/actionserver.log\r\n\t\t- updated actionserverctl\r\n\t\t- created new binary build\r\n\t\t- updated actionscript examples.\r\n\r\n\t1/18/10 - *v.1.0.8*\r\n\t\t- Changed message buffer to 8192 (8k) from 2048 (2k)\r\n\t\t- Changed max users to 500 (from 100)\r\n\r\n  \t\r\nLicense\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCopyright © 2011 Jason M Horwitz / Sekati LLC & Marcus Stoeger.
